Page 7252 Date 06122023 B Information Technology 1 PART 1. INTRODUCTION 1. Contents of the TER These Teaching and Examination Regulations provide students with information about teaching and testing of the B Information Technology CROHOnumber 34479. In this document, we refer to the Teaching and Examination Regulations as the TER. The TER also contains the rules that apply to teaching and testing. The TER concerns teaching in the programme in all forms and variants, for both the September and February intakes. As well as regular students further referred to simply as students, higher education programmes can include external students. Enrolment as an external student only entitles the student to take tests, not to attend classes. The TER only applies to students. The provisions relating to testing and examinations also apply to external students. 2. Organisation of this document We expect students to be familiar with the contents of the TER. That does not mean that everyone has to learn the text by heart, but students who have general questions or problems should first check to see whether the TER can clarify the matter. Students can do a quick check for information by using the table of contents or the index. Note the index does not indicate every single place where a word or concept is mentioned, but it does point to the place where the definition or key information can be found. The TER applies to all students, regardless of when they first enrolled. This means that what was written in last years TER does not automatically apply this year. Changes may have been made. Students who have to repeat or make up a component from a previous year therefore cannot assume that everything will still be the same. It is important to check the content, procedures and rules for this year in good time. As much as possible, we explain the concepts that we use in this TER within the part of the text that deals with that concept. But we sometimes need to use a concept that we havent already explained.

Chunk 7:
In that case, you can use the index to find the definition of the concept. The TER consists of ten parts. Most of these are further divided into chapters. All topics covered by the chapters have a heading in bold. These headings appear in the table of contents. These components articles are numbered sequentially, from Article 1 to Article 185. Page 8252 Date 06122023 B Information Technology 2 PART 2. THE EXAMINATION BOARD AND THE TER 3. The Examination Board The programme has an Examination Board. More information on the Examination Board can be found on Iris. Chapter 2 of the Education Guide contains a comprehensive explanation of the duties and powers of the Examination Board. The university believes it is important to have professionally run Examination Boards which  are conscious of their independent and expert task of keeping a watchful eye over the programmes, to ensure they are at an appropriate level of higher professional education;  perform their work in accordance with the applicable laws and regulations; and  occupy a strong position as an independent advisory body for the faculty director and programme management. The TER describes the duties and powers of the Examination Board just as they are described in the Dutch Higher Education and Research Act Wet op het hoger onderwijs en wetenschappelijk onderzoek, or WHW. In individual cases, the Examination Board may decide to deviate from a rule in this TER. Students must always submit a request for a deviation. Via this link students can read how and to whom they can submit requests. If there are special or personal circumstances, students should mention these as soon as possible to the student counselor. The Examination Board handles requests only if they are submitted within the specified timeframe. If no timeframe is specified, students may submit requests at any time. Requests should be submitted as soon as possible. The Examination Board needs time to properly consider requests. The Examination Board will specify the requirements that requests must meet and the supporting documents that must be included with requests. For some matters, the TER specifies a timeframe within which an Examination Board will make its decision. The timeframe is expressed in working days. Working day means any day from Monday up to and including Friday.

Chunk 8:
The following days are not working days public holidays set by the government; days on which the university is closed, as specified in the annual calendar. For other requests and complaints, the decisionmaking timeframe is specified in the digital form which students must use to submit their request or complaint. If a request is incomplete or was not submitted in the correct manner, the timeframe will start to run only when the request has been correctly submitted; and the student has supplied all necessary information. 4. Disagreeing with a decision made under the TER In Chapter 2 of this Education Guide and on Iris, under Knowing  Arranging, Objection and Appeal, students can find a list of decisions by the Examination Board, an examiner or the faculty director, against which a student can lodge an appeal or objection. It is also explained what objection and appeal mean and what the procedure is. For all decisions that are subject to objection or appeal, the process and timeframes for submitting an objection or appeal are specified. Page 9252 Date 06122023 B Information Technology 3 PART 3. TEACHING Chapter 1. Objectives and professions for which students are trained 5. Objectives, professional requirements and degree The programme trains students to develop initial ability into professionalism. The programme has been set up in such a manner that the students can achieve the objectives with regard to knowledge, attitude, understanding and skills. Hereinafter, we refer to these four attributes as final qualifications. On receipt of the degree certificate, the degree for the Bachelor of Science programme will be awarded to the student. The Information Technology  IT Professional who graduated from Inholland is an independent thinking professional who can make a meaningful contribution to the inclusive and sustainable globalized world of tomorrow with practical knowledge. This makes him one of the top programmers of the future. He can adapt to the rapidly changing digital world of the future and devises and develops sustainable and innovative solutions to create a sustainable and inclusive world. Inhollands Information Technology professional graduates can be employed in the full spectrum of the ICT services sector. He develops software and user interfaces for the implementation of new ICT systems, the redesign of existing ICT systems and the management of ICT systems.

Chunk 9:
To this end, the graduated Informatics  IT professional has a wide range of specialised uptodate knowledge and skills, with a focus on writing and developing programs Software development computer and mobile Cloud computing design, implement and manage cloudrelated systems, service integration and management AI and machine learning also dealing and cooperating with supporting AI and partly autonomously operating AI Data analytics and data science Cyber security Inhollands Computer Science  IT professional graduate applies these technologies in an integrated manner to provide pleasant user experiences, functionalities and services to employees, partners and customers. He realizes that it is no longer about the software and networks, but about the users and the experiences they have using it. Those users and their experiences are therefore his focus. He can empathize with the users and understands their wishes and needs. He is able to ask for those wishes and needs and to use big data to gain insights regarding the users. He also has insight into and can deal with social unrest and resistance to technology. Chapter 2. Form and structure of the programme 6. Study load The study load of a programme is expressed in credits. Each credit represents an average of 28 hours of study. These credits are equivalent to the European Credits ECTS used in European higher education institutions. The study load is Bachelors programme 240 credits foundation phase 60 credits, main phase 180 credits. 7. Foundation phase and main phase The Bachelors programme is divided into a foundation phase and a main phase. In the foundation phase, students discover the content of the programme, the profession and what final qualifications are necessary for the programme. The purpose of the foundation phase is orientation, referral and selection. The foundation phase Page 10252 Date 06122023 B Information Technology ends with the foundation examination. Students pass the foundation examination if they have completed all units of study of the foundation phase successfully. See also Article 9. Units of study. The main phase follows after the foundation phase. The main phase ends with the final examination. Students pass the final examination if they have successfully completed all units of study in the main phase. 8. Joint foundation year The programme does not have a joint foundation examination. 9. Units of study The programme is divided into units of study.

Chunk 10:
Each unit of study consists of educational activities that aim to help students acquire knowledge, skills, understanding, attitudes and reflection; relate to each other and form one entity. The study load of a unit of study is expressed in whole credits. A unit of study may be further divided into modules. A module is a part of a unit of study for which a test applies. Students complete each unit of study with one or more tests. See also Articles 93. Oral tests and 94. Other types of tests. Chapter 3. Basic curriculum, specialisation, main subject, 10. Basic curriculum Every programme has a basic curriculum. This consists of the units of study that are mandatory for all students. In addition to the basic curriculum, students are presented with a range of additional optional subjects. A Bachelors programme can have specialisations or main subjects, or both. Programmes can also have different forms and variants. 11. Specialisation The programme has no specialisation. 12. Main subject A main subject has a narrower focus than a specialisation. Students take a set of units of study, which are linked to one another; relate to a specific profession or discipline or a focus area within a profession or discipline. Main subjects appear on degree certificates. The programme has the following main subject Mobile Development 13. Optional subjects De program Information Technology offers the following optional subjects Cloud computing Mobile Development Security User Experience Big Data  AI Free minor Software Development These optional subjects minors are offered in both years 3 and 4. It can be taken within the students own study program, at one Page 11252 Date 06122023 B Information Technology of the professorships within the research group, via Kies op Maat at another University of Applied sciences or at another university abroad. A student may take a maximum of 30 ECs of optional subjects minors outside the study program. If a student wishes to follow 15 or 30 ECs of optional subjects minors outside the study program, he  she must submit a plan to the Examination Board for approval in consultation with his  her study counselor. In this plan, the student must describe how he  she will obtain the competences of the bachelors degree in Information Technology at the Start Qualified level.

A minor at another University or University of Applied Sciences must meet the following criteria The chosen minor is a coherent package of 15 EC or 30 EC You choose the entire package and cannot choose individual components The student must choose at least 30 EC from the minors offered by our study programme. The student can therefore complete a maximum of 30 EC outside the study programme. Only fully completed external minors can be entered into the grading system. The external minor are at least Bachelor level 3. The external minor must have added value in relation to the chosen or to be followed minors of the own study programme. In the case of an external minor, the student must be able to justify in a letter of motivation how the minor contributes to hisher own professional development as an intended ICT professional. The student can submit a maximum of 1 application for an external minor to the Board of Examiners at a time. 14. Form fulltime, parttime, dual Programmes are offered in fulltime form, in parttime form andor in dual form. With a fulltime programme, the teaching is arranged so that students spend 1,680 hours per year on their studies, spread over 42 weeks. A parttime programme is set up so that the studies can fit in with a job, in the evenings or for a few hours in the daytime. Sometimes requirements apply to the job. Students cannot follow a parttime programme if they do not meet these requirements. With a dual programme, students work during their studies, or during parts of their studies. Their work is part of the programme, the professional component. Students get credits for this part, provided they get a good evaluation. The structure of the curriculum and the content of the units of study may differ between the various forms. But the final qualifications learning outcomes that students ultimately achieve and the total study load are the same for all forms. Information Technology is only offered in fulltime. 15. Programme variants Programmes can have different variants. The variants for the B Information Technologyprogramme are The programme does not have variants. The structure of the curriculum and the content of the units of study may differ between the variants, but the final qualifications learning outcomes that students ultimately achieve are the same for all variants. 16.

Chunk 12:
Honours programme The program offers an honors program for students who want to develop into excellent professionals. Excellent professionals, in collaboration with others, come up with innovative solutions that are of practical significance for tackling socially important issues. For the honours program, the study program selects the participants on the basis of selection criteria that are known in advance. If the student completes the study program including an honors program, the certificate will state Honours Program. The content of the program is stated in the diploma supplement. A diploma supplement is an Englishlanguage document containing the most important information about the study program that the student has completed and the results he has achieved. explanation Page 12252 Date 06122023 B Information Technology 17. Additional programmes The programme does not offer an additional programme. 18. Transition from Bachelors to Masters programmes Does the Bachelors programme have a transition programme for moving on to its own Masters programme, or to a Masters associated with another programme or at another institution? The Bachelors programme does not have a transition programme for moving on to its own Masters programme, or to a Masters associated with another programme or at another institution. 19. Transition from Ad to Bachelors programmes not applicable to Bachelors programme This Article is not applicable to the Bachelors programme. The Ad programme has a separate TER. Chapter 4. Programme structure, content and evaluation 20. Terms and calendar The academic year comprises four terms, each approximately ten weeks long. There may also be a fifth term, which then runs from midJuly to the end of August. See attached Schedule 21. Curriculum obsolescence and updating The programme curriculum is updated regularly. The changes may be minor or major. Minor changes do not result in units of study or modules being renamed. There will be minor changes to the curriculum for this program in the coming year. The following tests will no longer be included in the 20222023 curriculum.

Expiry dates of units of study and modules Major changes result in the setting of an expiry date.

Chunk 13:
The expiry date is the last date on which the unit of study or module, with the associated tests, will form part of the programme curriculum. If a module has an expiry date, the entire unit of study will expire on that date. Modules that are part of that unit of study but are not scheduled to expire will be incorporated into other units of study. The same applies to any test results or exemptions associated with the module. That other unit of study may be an existing unit of study or a new unit of study. If a module is incorporated into another unit of study, a new weighting of its test will be set for the purpose of determining the final grade for that unit of study. See also Article 127. Grade for a unit of study. The following tests have an expiration date of August 31, 202.

Expiry date, transition period and validity period The expiry date will be the last day of an academic year. We will announce the expiry date by no later than the first day of the next academic year. Depending on the timing of the announcement, a transition period may be added to the expiry date, by adding 1 yr or 2 yrs. If students have already attended some of the classes for the unit of study that is going to expire, they are entitled to education based on the old programme as preparation for the associated tests, for the duration of the transition period. During that period, they are also entitled to sit the associated tests. If they do not complete the entire unit of study within the transition period, they will have to attend the replacement classes instead, and sit the replacement tests. The following tests will no longer be included in the 20222023 curriculum.

Students who had already completed this component of the unit of study must bear in mind that their test results will have limited validity. See also Article 146. Limited validity period for tests and exemptions and following. If students do not succeed in completing the entire programme within the validity period applicable to them, they will have to attend the replacement classes instead, and sit the replacement tests. 24. Evaluation of the programme The faculty works with two quality cycles whom both consist of four steps of PlanDoActCheck PDCA. The smallquality cycle focuses on monitoring and improving the results per eduational term or semester. four or two times per academic year. After every term the teaching staff as well as the students discuss their analyses and points of improvement. The large quality cycle focuses on the integration of the different evaluations conducted in one academic year. It integrates the evaluations of the students, workfield, alumni and employees. and gives an overview of all these results. Page 14252 Date 06122023 B Information Technology 4 PART 4. ADMISSION Chapter 1. Admission to the foundation phase 25. General rules of admission The rules on admission to the foundation phase are set out in the Rules on enrolment and deregistration of Inholland University of Applied Sciences. This document can be found on the website and on Iris and is briefly discussed in Chapter 2 of this Education Guide. If prescribed by the WHW, these rules are included in the Rules on enrolment and deregistration. This applies at any rate to the entrance examination; the examination for persons aged 21 years or older who do not meet the admission requirements 21 examination; the prior education and entrance requirements for students who do not come from a country in the European Economic Area EEA; the requirements for enrolling in a programme that will be partly or entirely taught in the English language. 26.

Chunk 15:
Admission following an interruption in enrolment Students whose programme was interrupted by deregistration and who wish to reenrol must ask the programme upon re enrolment which results they have already achieved and to what extent these fit in with the programme as it applies at the time of reenrolment. The programme will let these students know in writing what additional classes and tests they must take to match up with the tests they have passed and which exemptions they have. The students must also comply with the other rules for enrolment and deregistration. Enrolment for a programme that is being phased out is not possible. 27. Admission to a parttime programme The programme has no parttime form. 28. Admission to a dual programme and workstudy agreements The programme has no dual form. Chapter 2. Admission to the main phase 29. Admission to classes and tests in the main phase with a foundation certificate awarded by Inholland To be admitted to the main phase, students need either a foundation certificate from the programme or a joint foundation phase exam that also applies to the programme. The faculty director may determine in this respect that a student will not be admitted to one or more specialisations or main subjects. More information is provided in Article 38. Exclusion from main subjects or specialisations. Generally speaking, admission to the main phase means that students are admitted to all units of study and tests. However, for some units of study additional conditions apply before students can take classes or sit tests. More information is provided in article 31a. Students must meet these conditions before they can take part in those units of study. Careful thought has been given to the structure of the curriculum and the order of the units of study. However, students are not required to follow this order. Page 15252 Date 06122023 B Information Technology 30. Admission to the main phase with a foundation certificate awarded by another institution of higher professional education If students have a foundation certificate from another institution of higher professional education, the Examination Board will assess for which units of study they may be offered an exemption or whether they can start the main phase straight away. The Examination Board will make its decision within 30 working days after receiving a complete request. 31.

Chunk 16:
Admission to main phase classes and tests without a foundation certificate If the student does not yet have a foundation certificate and has also not met the binding study recommendation standard, they can still attend the units of study in the main phasethe second year. If special conditions apply to participation in a unit of study, students can only attend the unit of study if they meet these conditions. 31.a Entry and transfer requirements for units of study from the second year In order to participate in the Code Generation Project 2.4, the student must complete the Building applications Project 1.4 sufficiently. See articles 35 and 36. Chapter 3. Switching 32. Switching between forms and variants Switching between forms and variants within a programme is allowed. Students must comply with the conditions for admission and enrolment that apply to the form or variant to which they wish to switch. The Examination Board will determine how students test results and exemptions will be incorporated into the form or variant to which they are switching. 33. Switching between programmes with a joint foundation examination With a joint foundation exam, students are enrolled in one specific programme, and their results are recorded towards that programme. If students switch to another programme with the same joint foundation exam before completing their foundation phase, they retain their results and exemptions from the foundation programme. These are transferred to the new programme, with the dates on which the results were achieved being maintained. If students switch programmes after receiving a foundation certificate, no new foundation certificate will be awarded for the new programme. Any warnings issued as part of the binding study recommendation remain applicable after a switch. If students have received a binding study recommendation for one of the programmes with a joint foundation exam, they cannot switch to another programme with the same joint foundation exam. 34. Switching between Ad and Bachelors programmes Students cannot switch from an Ad programme to the Bachelors programme. Chapter 4. Admission to work placements and graduation programmes 35. Work placements Students require permission from the programme to be able to start a unit of study that includes a work placement component. Permission is granted through the signing of a placement contract by or on behalf of the faculty director.

Chunk 17:
If other conditions apply to participation in the unit of study, students must meet these as well before they can participate. The Page 16252 Date 06122023 B Information Technology programme deals with these conditions with leniency. In Week 4 of the term prior to the term in which students are due to start their internships, steps will be taken to establish whether or not they have met the conditions for participation in the internship. To be able to start the internship, the following entry requirements must have been met by this reference date A minimum of 90 credits has been attained; Passed the Interview and Reporting Test 1918IN131B; The projects group work that fall in the same term as the internship have been completed successfully. Students will be able to start their internship in any term, provided they meet all of the entry requirements by Week 4 of the previous term. The reference period for anyone wanting to start an internship in Term 1 is Week 4 of Term 4. If you want to go on Internship even though you do not meet all the conditions you can contact the Internship coordinator. In special circumstances you can submit a request with sufficient arguments to go on Internship. The Internship coordinator will discuss your request with the head of department and together they will make a decision. If you do not agree with their decision you can submit a request to the Exam Board. Exception for Term 5 Students who have obtained a minimum of 100 credits by the end of the academic year term 4 may lodge a request with the committee prior to week 1 of term 5 in which they explain why they want to start their internship in term 1. The placement committee will make a decision in Week 1 of Term 5. No supervision will be provided in Term 5. This means that the internship will take place in Term 4 and Term 1 of the next academic year if a student starts his internship in Term 4. 36. Graduation programmes Students require permission from the programme to be able to take a unit of study that is part of a graduation programme. The graduation programme consists of units of study with one or more graduation products.

Chunk 18:
To start the graduation programme, the following admission requirements apply The propaedeutic phase has been passed The 3rd year internship has been successfully completed. A minimum of 185 ECs were obtained in week 3 of the period prior to the start of graduation. If you want to go on Graduation Project even though you do not meet all the conditions you can contact the Graduation coordinator. In special circumstances you can submit a request with sufficient arguments to go on Graduation Project. The Graduation coordinator will discuss your request with the head of department and together they will make a decision. If you do not agree with their decision you can submit a request to the Exam Board. Chapter 5. Admission to optional subjects, main subjects and specialisations 37. Optional subjects In semester 2 of year 3 you can choose between User Experience period 3 and Security period 4 Big Data  AI period 3 and 4 In semester 1 of year 4 you can choose between Mobile Development period 1 and 2 Cloud Computing period 1 and 2 38. Exclusion from main subjects or specialisations Students select a main subject and specialisation from the range offered by their programme. However, the faculty director may Page 17252 Date 06122023 B Information Technology decide not to allow a student to take a main subject or specialisation, if differences in the nature and content of that main subject or specialisation justify such a decision. In making the decision, the faculty director takes into consideration the study results, the programme as followed by the student, or both, and the relationship between these and the content of the main subject or specialisation. . 39. Participation in more than one main subject or specialisation If students wish to participate in more than one main subject or specialisation, they must indicate in advance to the Examination Board for which main subject or specialisation they wish to take the final examination. The choice for one particular graduation track is specified on the certificate. The other choice is extracurricular. This means that this choice is not part of the programme itself. Specialisations are not reported on the certificate. All units of study that the students have successfully completed will be included in the list of grades and the diploma supplement. Chapter 6. Admission to optional subjects 40.

Chunk 19:
Optional subjects The programme offers the following options  electives Mobile Applications and Cloud 4th year  electives Big Data  AI, UX and Security 3rd year The descriptions of the programmes elective units are included at the end of this chapter. The conditions for participating in the electives are Propedeuse achieved. Internship in the third year achieved. The electives 15 or 30 EC are offered both in year 3 and year 4. These may be followed as part of our own programme or as part of one of the associated programmes. Students may take at most 30 EC of electives at an associated programme. If students wish to take 30 EC of electives outside of their own programme, they must write a plan in consultation with their study supervisor and submit it to the Examination Board for approval. This plan must explain how the student intends to achieve the competencies of a Bachelor of ICT at the Competent to Start level. A minor at another University or University of Applied Sciences must meet the following criteria The chosen minor is a coherent package of 15 EC or 30 EC You choose the entire package and cannot choose individual components The student must choose at least 30 EC from the minors offered by our study programme. The student can therefore complete a maximum of 30 EC outside the study programme. Only fully completed external minors can be entered into the grading system. The external minor are at least Bachelor level 3. The external minor must have added value in relation to the chosen or to be followed minors of the own study programme. In the case of an external minor, the student must be able to justify in a letter of motivation how the minor contributes to hisher own professional development as an intended ICT professional. The student can submit a maximum of 1 application for an external minor to the Board of Examiners at a time. Within our own programme, the major consists of elective units and the individual graduation research which is linked to a complex professional situation. This graduation research must be aligned with the chosen electives. The completed major will be noted in the supplement to the students diploma. 41.

Chunk 20:
Optional subjects package Optional subjects will be offered as a package because this is necessary to achieve the final qualifications learning objectives for Page 18252 Date 06122023 B Information Technology the programme. The students are required to select the entire package. The name of the package only appears on the list of grades and the diploma supplement, if students have completed the entire package. 42. Exemption and substitution of optional subjects Students can request an exemption from the Examination Board if they have taken certain tests as part of another programme. In this case, they must choose an optional subject first and then apply for an exemption. Chapter 18. Exemptions, particularly Article 160. Exemptions procedure and evidence, contains more information about how students can apply for exemptions and the requirement that they must state the reasons why they need an exemption. Students can also request the Examination Board to grant them permission to take other units of study that allow for national and international mobility. These are known as substitute units of study, as explained in Article 167. Request for substitution and following Articles. 43. Permission by the Examination Board for optional subjects If students choose an optional subject that is not offered by their own programme, they must first discuss the choice with their study counsellor. They must then submit a request to the Examination Board. In the request, they must indicate how the choice aligns with the profile of their programme in terms of final qualifications learning objectives and level; how the choice relates to the phase of the programme in which they are making the choice; how the choice fits in with their personal goals. The Examination Board will make a decision within fifteen working days. 44. Changing a selected optional subject Students can change their choice of optional subject at any time up until five weeks at the latest before the start of term. To do so, they must repeat the procedure set out in Articles 42. Exemption and substitution of optional subjects and 43. Permission by the Examination Board for optional subjects. 45. Extra optional subjects Students can obtain extra credits by taking more optional subjects than provided for in the graduation programme. In this case, they must let the Examination Board know which units of study are extracurricular. These units of study do not form part of the final examination.

Chunk 21:
Students who choose to take extra optional subjects are recommended to take note of the provisions of Articles 175. Degree certificate and 177. Deferral of awarding of the degree certificate when deciding on the order in which to complete the optional subjects. These articles determine when a degree certificate will be awarded and when the awarding of the certificate will be postponed. Page 19252 Date 06122023 B Information Technology 5 PART 5. APPLYING FOR UNITS OF STUDY Chapter 1. Applying for units of study in the basic curriculum 46. Applying for units of study Students do not need to apply to take units of study in the basic curriculum. However, applications are sometimes necessary for the organisation of the programme, for instance in the case of field trips. Where an application is required, it will be stated in the unit of study description. Students will be informed as quickly as possible as to whether they can take the units of study for which they have applied. They will receive this information at least two weeks before the unit of study is due to start. If there are more applicants than places, students will be placed in the order in which they applied. Students for whom the unit of study is an integral part of their basic curriculum will be given preference ahead of students for whom this is not the case. Students who cannot be placed will be offered an alternative option. Chapter 2. Applications and placement for optional subject 47. Applying Students must apply in good time to take optional subjects. The information provided on optional subjects will specify how and when students can apply. If a minimum number of students is necessary in order for an optional subject to go ahead, this will be announced in advance. Students will also be notified in advance if there is a cap on student numbers for an optional subject. Students who were previously admitted to an optional subject but did not start it must apply again, stating previously admitted as their reason. 48. Placement Students who apply for optional subjects in good time and according to the correct procedure will be placed in those optional subjects, unless there are too many or too few applications. For Study Abroad, other guidelines apply for the placement.

Chunk 22:
For more information, check the student handbook Study Abroad, 31.a Entry and transfer requirements for units of study from the second year, 37. Optional subjects or article 40. Optional subjects. At least six weeks before the start of term, students will be notified whether they have been placed in their optional subjects. If they have not been given a place, they will be notified of the reasons for this, and also how and within what timeframe they can make a new choice. Note Placement alone is not always in itself sufficient for a student to be able to take a unit of study. If other conditions apply for participation in the unit of study, students must meet these too. 49. Too few applications If fewer than the minimum number of applications are received, the faculty director responsible for that optional subject may decide not to allow the unit of study to go ahead. In that case, the faculty director will offer the students who applied for the optional subject one or more alternative options. Where possible, this will include the option of taking the same or a similar optional subject at another location. Page 20252 Date 06122023 B Information Technology 50. Too many applications If too many applications are received, students will be placed in the order in which they applied. Applications for optional subjects that are not extracurricular will be given priority. See also Article 45. Extra optional subjects. The faculty director will offer students who are not given a place one or more alternative options. This may include the option of taking the same or a similar optional subject at another location. For Study Abroad, other guidelines apply for the placement. For more information, check the student handbook Study Abroad, 31.a Entry and transfer requirements for units of study from the second year, 37. Optional subjects or article 40. Optional subjects. Page 21252 Date 06122023 B Information Technology 6 PART 6. STUDY COUNSELLING Chapter 1. Study counselling 51. Mandatory component of the programme for all students Every student will receive study counselling and have a study counsellor. Study counselling is a mandatory component of the programme. It is related to the students academic phase. It is also possible to receive advice and counselling regarding personal circumstances  see the Student Counsellor page on Iris. 52.

Chunk 23:
Content of study counselling At a minimum, study counselling includes guidance on choices during students studies; academic progress; the study recommendation. Students can view their own academic progress electronically. Within study supervision SS, all students learn how to manage their own academic career. They learn to recognise and utilise their strengths, get to know their limitations through feedback and reflection and become able to create a personal development plan. Discussions cover study progress, development of competencies, choices and any factors inhibiting study. The student supervisor plays a supporting role in this. However, students are responsible for their own learning process and are expected to have a proactive attitude. In this context, the following points are important Students discuss their study progress with their study supervisor. Students take a resultoriented approach to their work. Once learning goals and activities have been established, concrete arrangements can be agreed with the study supervisor. Students learn to learn. They have an understanding of their own learning style, they know what drives them and what doesnt and are able to plan efficiently. Students take responsibility for their own learning process and the choices this entails. This includes the choice of an internship position, graduation project, etc. Students reflect critically on their own performance and developing level of competence. Based on this, viable learning goals may be set enabling better planning of activities. Study supervision runs throughout the four years of study. There are two manuals one for the propaedeutic phase and one for the main phase. The study supervisor keeps a record of the assignments as described in the manual. To meet their SS requirements, students must attend the compulsory individual discussions and complete the assignments, as defined in the SS manual, to the satisfaction of the study supervisor. Together with the various deliverables produced during the study, the collected assignments make up the students portfolio. This is how they demonstrate their competence development over four years of study. Students who receive a BSA warning have a meeting with the study supervisor to discuss any circumstances inhibiting their studies and, if appropriate, to establish an action plan in order to eliminate the backlog. Page 22252 Date 06122023 B Information Technology Chapter 2. Recording data as part of study counselling 53. Recording data in study counselling For each student, the study counsellor will record the agreements made during study counselling sessions.

Chunk 24:
For disabled students, the study counsellor will also record the relevant agreements they have made. The same applies to agreements with students enrolled as elite athletes. Students will be given a copy of these agreements on request. For disabled students, more information is given in Article 107. Disability and for elite athletes in Article 66. Adjusted standards for elite athletes and Chapter 2 of this Education Guide. Students are entitled to view the information recorded about them. Page 23252 Date 06122023 B Information Technology 7 PART 7. STUDY RECOMMENDATION AND BINDING STUDY RECOMMENDATION Chapter 1. Study recommendation 54. Content of study recommendation At the end of the first year of enrolment in the foundation phase of the Bachelors programme or the Ad programme, students receive a positive or deferred study recommendation in writing from the faculty director relating to the continuation of their studies within the programme or elsewhere. This study recommendation is based on the test results recorded in the PeopleSoft academic monitoring system. Where necessary, the study recommendation will include a warning or a rejection. More information on a warning is given in 77. Warning, and more information about rejections is contained in Articles 56. Quantitative academic performance standard to 63. The study recommendation applies to all forms and variants of the programme. If a student switches from one form or variant to another and the programmes are different, the faculty director will adjust the study recommendation after the switch if necessary. 55. When study recommendations will be issued The student who enrolled in September will receive the study recommendation by 31 July at the latest. The student who enrolled in February will receive the study recommendation at the latest by the first of March of the second year of enrollment. The study recommendation contains a recommendation of the first twelve months of the study, to and including 31 January. Students who enroll on any other date than 1 September or 1 Februari will receive their study recommendations at the latest on 31 July 2023 for cohort 2122 and cohort 2223 if they started in the September intake; at the latest on 1 March 2024 for cohort 2021 and cohort 2223 if they started in the February intake. The standards for the study recommendation are set out in Article 67. Different standard for interim entrants. Chapter 2. Binding study recommendation in the first year of enrolment 56.

Chunk 25:
Quantitative academic performance standard a. Level of the quantitative academic performance standard At the end of the first year of enrolment in the programme, students must have obtained at least 45 of the 60 available credits in the foundation phase. When students have obtained at least 40 credits, of which 25 credits in period 3 and 4, the quantitative standard has been met. Please note this is a pilot. b. Quantitative academic performance standard where exemptions have been granted If students have been granted exemptions from the tests for one or more units of study, the quantitative academic performance standard will be 84 5060 of the remaining number of credits in the foundation phase. This rule also applies to the accelerated Page 24252 Date 06122023 B Information Technology curriculum for students with a preuniversity education. If the student has exemptions, 75 of the remaining units of study must be passed. This is rounded up to whole credits. 57. Qualitative academic performance standard The programme has no qualitative standard for the binding study recommendation. 58. Issuing of binding study recommendation Students must meet the quantitative academic performance standard by the end of the first year of enrolment. If the programme has set a qualitative academic performance standard, students must also meet that standard. If students meet the academic performance standard by the end of the first year of enrolment, they will receive a positive binding study recommendation. If students do not meet the academic performance standard by the end of the first year of study, the binding study recommendation will be postponed. Students from cohort 20212022 will have the opportunity until 31 July 2023 September intake or 1 March 2024 February intake to meet the academic performance standard as set out in article 61. No advice from the student counsellor is required in this respect. 59. Binding study recommendation and personal circumstances The faculty director will not issue binding study recommendations where students have not been able to comply with the standards for binding study recommendations due to personal circumstances. The procedure for providing evidence of personal circumstances is set out in Articles 82. Personal circumstances and 85. Definition of personal circumstances.

Chunk 26:
If the programme has set a qualitative academic performance standard and the student has not achieved that standard, and if the personal circumstances which prevented the student from achieving the quantitative academic performance standard did not present an obstacle to meeting the qualitative standard, the faculty director will always issue a negative binding study recommendation. 60. Binding study recommendation and switching out of the accelerated variant This article does not apply to the programme B Information Technology. Chapter 3. Binding study recommendation after the first year of enrolment 61. Standard for a binding study recommendation after the first year If a student did not meet the minimum standard quantitative and possibly qualitative at the end of the first year and the faculty director could not provide a binding study advice, then they must pass the entire firstyear program during or by the end of the second year of enrollment or within the given deadline. This applies to students For whom a binding study advice could not be given due to personal circumstances; Who did not receive a binding study advice because their enrollment was interrupted. See also article 69. Binding study recommendation following an interruption in enrollment; Who had a significant backlog for the first time at the end of the fourth educational period, and it became apparent that there was a backlog. See also article 77. Warning; Whose examination results after the first year clearly indicate the students suitability. See also article 62. When a binding study recommendation will be issued after the first year. 62. When a binding study recommendation will be issued after the first year The faculty director will issue a binding study recommendation upon determination that the student cannot successfully complete the remainder of the firstyear programme within the timeframe granted to the student. The faculty director will not give a negative binding study recommendation if there are personal circumstances; see also Article 82. Personal circumstances. It is necessary that the student counsellor issues advice. Page 25252 Date 06122023 B Information Technology The faculty director will give a positive recommendation if the test results for the programme after the first year clearly indicate the students suitability. 63.

Chunk 27:
Extending the timeframe It is possible that, due to personal circumstances, a student may not receive a binding study recommendation during or at the end of the second year of enrolment but will instead receive a warning stating a timeframe. If it subsequently becomes apparent that the student is unable to meet the standard within that timeframe, the faculty director will issue a binding study recommendation at the end of the timeframe specified in the letter. If relevant personal circumstances still exist, the faculty director will again take the severity of these circumstances into account. See also Article 82. Personal circumstances. Chapter 4. Consequences of a binding study recommendation and when enrolment will end 64. Termination of enrolment Students who have received a binding study recommendation from Inholland cannot continue with the programme. Their enrolment will be terminated. 65. When the enrolment will end If a binding study recommendation is issued after 1 June, the enrolment will end on 31 August. If a binding study recommendation is issued earlier in the academic year, the enrolment will be terminated at the time immediately after the end of the last day of the month in which the binding study recommendation was issued. If there are only a few days remaining between the issuing of the recommendation and the last day of the month, the students enrolment will be terminated one month later. Chapter 5. Special cases and binding study recommendation 66. Adjusted standards for elite athletes An elite athlete is a student who meets the conditions set out in the Profile Fund Regulations. These regulations can be found in this Education Guide in Chapter 3.3. In addition to the provisions of Article 85 h, the faculty director may make an agreement with an elite athlete setting adjusted standards for the first year of enrolment. This will be done as soon as possible after enrolment. The faculty director will send the student a letter setting out the agreements. The faculty director may appoint someone else to make the agreements and send them to the student. 67. Different standard for interim entrants There is no different standard for interim students. Quantitative academic performance standard The faculty director will determine which credits the student will be unable to achieve upon entering in the interim, in light of the scheduling of the classes and tests. This number will be deducted from the firstyear study load.

Chunk 28:
The firstyear study load is 60 credits for the regular programme and 45 for the accelerated variant. The student must achieve 84 of the difference in the first year of enrolment. This number will be rounded up. If the student has exemptions, the percentage will be applied on the total number of credits minus the number of credits for the units of study for which the student has exemptions, and minus the number of credits that the student will be unable to achieve due to the scheduling of classes and tests. This number will be rounded up as well. Page 26252 Date 06122023 B Information Technology Qualitative academic performance standard If there is a qualitative academic performance standard, the number of credits for the units of study that form part of the standard and that the student cannot achieve due to entering in the interim will be deducted from that standard. Soon after the intake, the faculty director will determine what the quantitative and qualitative academic performance standards will be. The faculty director will consult the student first, and then send the student a letter setting out the standards. 68. Binding study recommendation and switching to another programme If students switch to another Bachelors programme or Ad programme, the rules of the binding study recommendation will again apply to the new programme. Important note After receiving a binding study recommendation, students cannot switch to a programme with the same foundation exam. It is also not possible, after having received a binding study recommendation, to switch from an Ad programme to a Bachelors programme or vice versa with the same foundation exam. The standards for binding study recommendations are set out in Article 56. Quantitative academic performance standard and 57. Qualitative academic performance standard. After receiving a binding study recommendation, students cannot transfer credits that they obtained in the old programme to the new programme. However, they can apply to the Examination Board for an exemption from tests if they meet the applicable conditions. See also Articles 155. Exemptions from tests to 162. Waiving further investigation. 69. Binding study recommendation following an interruption in enrolment Students who are deregistered less than two months after enrolment and reenrol in the same programme in a subsequent academic year will be subject to the same rules around warnings and binding study recommendations as students enrolling in the programme for the first time.

Chunk 29:
If a student from the September intake terminates their enrolment before receiving a binding study recommendation and then re enrols in a subsequent academic year, the binding study recommendation standard entails that they must pass the foundation examination in that year. When they enrol, the student will receive a warning notifying them of this fact. If a student from the February intake terminates their enrolment before September of that year and then reenrols in the same programme on 1 September, generally speaking the same rules will remain applicable to them regarding warnings and binding study recommendations. The quantitative academic performance standard may be adjusted in individual cases. If this is the case, it will be stated in the warning that the student receives at the time of reenrolment. If a student deregisters before the end of the academic year, and they could not have met the BSA standard anymore even if they hadnt deregistered, and if there are no personal circumstances as referred to in Article 85. Definition of personal circumstances, then a binding study recommendation will be issued. The rules in this Article also apply if a student reenrols for a programme with the same foundation exam as the programme in which they were previously enrolled. Chapter 6. Academic progress and international students 70. Students to whom these rules apply The rules in the following Articles up to and including Article 75 concerning academic progress apply to students who do not come from a member state of the EEA or from Switzerland these are students who require a residency permit; and 1. are covered by the Code of Conduct for International Students in Dutch Higher Education. 2. These rules are in addition to the rules on academic progress, study recommendations and binding study recommendations in this TER; and the academic progress requirements for students who receive a knowledge grant from the university under the Profile Fund Regulations. Page 27252 Date 06122023 B Information Technology 71. Criteria According to the Code of Conduct, students have made satisfactory academic progress if, in each academic year, they have achieved at least 15 credits by participating in tests in the first two terms; at least 30 credits over the entire academic year. 72.

Chunk 30:
Procedure at the end of Term 2 and Term 4 The faculty director determines students academic progress twice each year at the end of Term 2; and at the end of Term 4. If a student is deemed to have made unsatisfactory academic progress after Term 2 and at the end of the academic year, their study counsellor will discuss this with them. If there are any special circumstances as referred to in Article 86. Other special circumstances, the study counsellor will make a reasonable agreement with the student to ensure that their academic progress is restored to the required level as quickly as possible. The student is required to comply with this agreement. 73. Procedure at the end of the academic year If at the end of the academic year the faculty director finds that a student is no longer attending any classes at all, or their abilities are insufficient for the level of the programme, the university will report the student to the Immigration and Naturalisation Service IND within one month. The end of the academic year is always the end of JulyAugust, even for students from the February intake. If a student is failing to meet the progress standard that applies to them, this will be sufficient reason for determining that their abilities are insufficient for the level of the programme. This does not apply if the study counsellor has made an agreement with the student as described in Article 72. The faculty director will inform the student in a letter of his decision regarding the special circumstances relating to their failure to meet the required standard. This letter will include the faculty directors reasons, as well as information on how the student can appeal against the decision. 74. The university will refrain only once from reporting a student Where the same set of special circumstances is involved, reporting an international student to the IND for unsatisfactory academic progress can be refrained from only once during the entire period in which the international student is enrolled at the university. The Central Student Administration makes the report on behalf of the faculty director. 75. Records The faculty director makes a record of the unsatisfactory academic progress; the personal circumstances; and the fact that no report was made. Chapter 7. Procedure for issuing binding study recommendations 76.

Chunk 31:
No binding study recommendations without prior warning The faculty director must first give the student a written warning before issuing a binding study recommendation. 77. Warning If a students academic progress has been unsatisfactory during their first or second year of enrolment in the foundation phase, and as a consequence they are in danger of receiving a binding study recommendation, the student will receive a warning from the faculty director. The warning will be given in writing. Page 28252 Date 06122023 B Information Technology 78. When the warning will be sent The faculty director sends the warning in the first year during the term in which the students poor academic progress is first noted, or as soon as possible after the end of that term. If the faculty director only notices students poor academic progress in Term 4, and is unable to issue a warning due to the resits at the end of that term, the students will receive a warning that they must successfully complete the full firstyear curriculum in the second year of enrolment. The warning will form part of the study recommendation. If a student cannot meet the standard for avoiding a binding study recommendation due to personal circumstances, they will receive a warning that the foundation phase must be successfully completed during or by the end of the second year. The warning will form part of the study recommendation. 79. Content of the warning The warning will indicate the total number of credits that the student must obtain. The warning will also indicate the date by which the student must have obtained these credits. The terms in which classes for the units of study in question will be run, and the timing of the tests, are taken into account upon setting this date. The rule is that there should be two test opportunities per academic year, unless one of the exceptions in 96. Number of test opportunities per academic year If the student is subsequently given a new deadline due to personal circumstances, this applies only to the two test opportunities for the remaining units of study. 80. Scope of the warning The warning applies to all forms and variants of the programme. In the case of a joint foundation exam, the warning applies to all programmes with the same foundation exam. If the programme is run in multiple locations, the warning applies to all locations.

Chunk 32:
However, if students switch from one form, variant or location to another, and the curriculum is different, the warning may be adjusted if necessary. If such an adjustment is made during the first year of enrolment, only the standard will be adjusted. 81. Warning in the case of reenrolment following deregistration If a student does not receive a warning because they have already deregistered, and if they reenrol in the same programme, or in a programme with the same foundation examination, they will receive the warning as soon as possible after reenrolment. The standards for a Binding study recommendation following an interruption in enrolment, as described in Article 69. Binding study recommendation following an interruption in enrolment, will apply to the warning. 82. Personal circumstances Students may fall behind in their studies due to personal circumstances. Article 85 outlines what those personal circumstances might be. The faculty director takes any personal circumstances into account when deciding whether to issue a binding study recommendation. The faculty director can only do this if he or she is aware of the personal circumstances. Accordingly, students must report personal circumstances to the student counsellor. The faculty director will always seek advice from the student counselling service before issuing a binding study recommendation. The student counsellor will provide written advice. In the advice, the student counsellor will address  whether the student has reported personal circumstances as defined in article 85. Definition of personal circumstances;  if so, whether the student has delivered proof of the personal circumstances;  whether the student counsellor can establish a connection between the personal circumstances and the study credit deficit of the student;  if possible, for how many study credits the student has fallen behind due to the personal circumstances andor which period or courses the deficit relates to. The student counsellor will send the advice to the faculty director and to the student. The faculty director will also consult the Page 29252 Date 06122023 B Information Technology study counsellor about students academic progress and its connection to their personal circumstances. 83. Meeting Before a binding study recommendation is issued, students will be offered the opportunity to explain their side of the story to the faculty director or to someone else assigned to meet with students on behalf of the faculty director. Among other things, this meeting will include a discussion of whether the overview of academic results achieved is accurate.

Chunk 33:
The participants of the meeting will also look at whether the personal circumstances should be taken into account. If a student fails to take up an invitation to attend such a meeting, this will be noted in their student file. Chapter 8 Request for lifting a binding study recommendation 84. Lifting Students who have received a binding study recommendation may submit a request to the faculty director to review the rejection. Such review by the faculty director can take place no earlier than twelve months after the date on which the enrolment was terminated due to the binding study recommendation. In their request, students must provide plausible arguments to show that they will now be capable of successfully completing the programme. These arguments can be based by the students on activities, which may include studies, that the students have engaged in since leaving the programme. The faculty director will not review the rejection if the programme is being phased out or has been discontinued. Chapter 9. Special and personal circumstances and academic progress 85. Definition of personal circumstances The personal circumstances that can play a role in the decision of whether to issue a binding study recommendation as described in Article 82. Personal circumstances are a. student illness; b. physical, sensory or other disabilities; c. pregnancy of the student; d. special family circumstances; e. membership of a representative advisory council, faculty representative advisory council, student committee or programme committee at the university; f. membership of an accreditation committee, as specified in Chapter 5a of the WHW; g. membership of the board of a student organisation or other administrative activity, as explained in Article 23 of the Profile Fund Regulations, which can be found in the Education Guide; h. competing as an elite athlete see also Article 66. Adjusted standards for elite athletes; i. personal circumstances not listed in a to h above, which, if the board of the university did not take them into consideration, would lead to a significant and unfair disadvantage. 86. Other special circumstances In addition, the following provisions concerning the academic progress of international students Articles 70. Students to whom these rules apply to 75.

Students may also fall behind in their studies in a way that makes them eligible for financial assistance under one of the student financial support schemes as outlined in Chapter 3 of this Education Guide. 87. Procedure for establishing special and personal circumstances a. Notify the student counsellor as soon as possible If any of the circumstances set out in Articles 85. Definition of personal circumstances or 68. Binding study recommendation and switching to another programme arise and cause a student to fall behind with their studies, they should notify the student counsellor as soon as possible, stating the period of time for which the circumstances applied or will apply; what the circumstances are and how serious they are; the student must provide evidence; the extent to which the student was or will be unable to participate in classes or tests. All contacts with students are recorded in the student counselling information system. If students so wish, they can obtain a copy of everything recorded in the system about these contacts. b. Student Counsellors Declaration The student counsellor will draw up a Student Counsellors Declaration if a student has proven that personal or special circumstances are applicable; and the student counsellor has determined that the student has fallen behind or is likely to fall behind in their studies due to these circumstances. This declaration will specify the date of the first meeting about the circumstances and all matters listed under a above. The student counsellor may also include comments, advice and arrangements for the student or for discussion with the study counsellor. Some circumstances are confidential. If so, the student counsellor will discuss with the student what will be included in the declaration. c. Discussion with study counsellor and adjustment to study plan The student will show the Student Counsellors Declaration to their study counsellor and discuss with the study counsellor the inability to keep up with their studies and any advice they have been given. The student will then adjust their study plan. The discussion and adjustment to the study plan will take place as soon as possible after the meeting with the student counsellor. If the student involved is an international student, the study counsellor will also talk about the INDs progress requirements. See also Article 73. Procedure at the end of the academic year.

Chunk 35:
d. Request for special arrangement Based on special circumstances, a student in possession of a Student Counsellors Declaration or advice from the student counsellor, may request special arrangements at the Examination Board, the programme or the service organisation. 88. Confidentiality of personal circumstances Everyone who is aware of a notification of personal circumstances will handle the information in a confidential manner; and will use the information only as part of their duties and for the purpose of implementing the regulations in the Education Guide. The student counsellor complies with the code of conduct for student counsellors and will give information to the programme only within the scope of the student counsellors role; within the parameters of the agreements the student counsellor made with the student about the confidentiality of the information. Page 31252 Date 06122023 B Information Technology 8 PART 8. TESTS Chapter 1. Content and administration of tests and publication of test standards 89. Connection to unit of study The final qualifications or learning outcomes and the goals for each test are connected to the unit of study described in attachment Description units of study, or to a module within that unit of study. The project task or test questions will clearly and precisely state how students are expected to answer them. 90. Test duration Students will be given sufficient time to complete the test, according to reasonable benchmarks. 91. Test standards Test standards for practical work and group assignments are published prior to commencement of these assignments. The test standards are published prior to publishing the test results. Chapter 2. Types of tests 92. Types of tests 11 Appendix Annual Programmes of the TER specifies the types of tests. There are three types of tests, which can be detailed in various ways Written 1. Students answer test questions on paper or electronically, or they complete projects on paper or electronically. Oral 2. Students answer test questions in a meeting online or physical with one or more examiners. Other 3. For the test or project, students perform tasks that will be described clearly by the programme. Possibly a written, digital or oral component, or a combination of these, must also be completed. If necessary, the type of test can be changed during the academic year, with due regard to the participation in the decisionmaking process. Students will be informed of this in a timely manner. 93. Oral tests a.

Chunk 36:
One student examined orally at a time. In an oral test online or physical, one student is examined at a time, unless the Examination Board decides otherwise or if testing is conducted in a different manner. If so, this will be announced before the start of the unit of study. b. Examiners and public access Oral tests are conducted by two examiners. This may not be the case if it is not feasible from an organisational point of view, or if the test is administered online. In that case, the oral test must be recorded. This will not be the case for the parts of a degree programme. These will be administered by two examiners. An oral test is open to the public, because that ensures transparency and allows for monitoring of the conduct of the test. This does not apply if the Examination Board decides otherwise. Page 32252 Date 06122023 B Information Technology . c. Rules for conducting tests Oral tests are conducted by two internal examiners, or by one internal and one external examiner. An external examiner is an independent expert from the professional field. If an oral test online or physical is conducted by a single examiner, an audio or video recording is always made. d. Protocol For every oral test, a protocol will be drawn up. The examiners will sign the protocol. If an external examiner was involved in the test, he or she will also sign the protocol. The protocol will be preserved as specified in the universitys regulations on retention periods. If an audio recording of an oral test is made, it will be preserved as specified in the universitys regulations on retention periods. 94. Other types of tests Grounds Disabled students can ask the Examination Board if they can complete tests in a way that accommodates their disability as much as possible. They can also request any additional or adapted materials they may need to be able to complete the test. Students can also ask to complete tests in another form for other reasons. The Examination Board will only grant such requests in exceptional, individual cases. Adjustments are possible only if they do not change the test goals or the level of the test. Procedure Students must request an alternative form of test by the start of term at the latest. They should submit their requests in writing to the Examination Board.

Chunk 37:
The letter should set out the reasons for the request and enclose a copy of the advice received from the student counsellor Click here for more information about advice from the student counsellor. The Examination Board will make a decision as soon as possible, at any rate no later than fifteen working days after receiving the complete request. Chapter 3. Timing and frequency of tests 95. Timing of tests Each unit of study will, if possible, end with one or more tests in the term in which the teaching was delivered. If the teaching was delivered over a whole semester, the test will, if possible, take place in that semester. If a unit of study is composed of modules, the modules will likewise be completed, if possible, within the term or semester in which the unit of study was delivered. The year programme states when the tests take place. 96. Number of test opportunities per academic year For all tests of the programme in the form or variant as followed by the student, they will have two test opportunities per academic year, within normal term time. There are a number of exceptions to this rule. If there is an exemption, this will be set out in Schedule 1 of this TER. There may be only one test opportunity per academic year for tests after the first year, for which no resit can be scheduled in the same academic year due to the nature of the study unit. This applies, for example, to work placements in the fourth term. For some tests, the programme may indicate that students will be given more than two opportunities to complete them. Page 33252 Date 06122023 B Information Technology The programme may also indicate that it will offer only one test opportunity in each academic year. There are no exceptions in the number of test opportunities. Chapter 4. Resits Note The programme B Information Technology uses the test concept of programmatic assessment. We are not talking about resits, but about personalized recovery processes or remediation. Students are given the opportunity to demonstrate compliance with the set standard with additional evidence or documentation. The scope and the purport of the articles below do apply. 97. Timing of resits The final resit opportunity in the first year will be scheduled before the end of Term 4.

Chunk 38:
This is due to the fact that study recommendations need to be issued in time. For tests which form part of the curriculum from the second year onwards see the proviso in Part 7, resits can also be scheduled before the start of the new academic year. in other words, in Term 5. 98. Resit when test passed at first opportunity Students who have passed a test are not entitled to a resit. However, a student may want to resit a test in an exceptional situation. In this case, they must submit a request to the Examination Board, which will make a decision within thirty working days. If the Examination Board grants the request, the highest result that the student achieves will apply. 99. Additional opportunity due to special circumstances In exceptional cases, the Examination Board may decide to provide an additional test opportunity. This will only occur if personal circumstances exist as described in Article 85. Definition of personal circumstances, or in other extremely exceptional cases. Students must submit a request to the Examination Board and state the reasons for their request. The Examination Board will seek advice from the student counsellor, if the Board deems this to be necessary. The Examination Board will make a decision within fifteen working days. The programme offers no extra resits after 1 July for students in their first year. This is because these students will receive their study reccomendation by 31 July 2024 at the latest. 100. Resits in the context of curriculum obsolescence and updating Special rules apply to resits if a curriculum is obsolete or being updated. See Articles 21. Curriculum obsolescence and updating to 24. Evaluation of the programme. Chapter 5. Bringing forward test opportunities 101. Bringing forward An Examination Board may permit a student, on a oneoff basis, to take one or more tests earlier, so that the student can pass the final examination without a disproportionate delay. This is subject to the condition that bringing forward the test opportunity is reasonably possible. If both test opportunities in the academic year have already passed, the student will be given a third test opportunity. The student must submit a request to the Examination Board and state the reasons for the request. The Examination Board will make its decision within fifteen working days after receiving the complete request.

Chunk 39:
The Examination Page 34252 Date 06122023 B Information Technology Board deals with these requests with leniency. 102. Conditions for bringing forward test opportunities For a test opportunity to be brought forward, the student must meet the following conditions They must have a maximum of 10 credits left to obtain for a 240 credits programme, or a maximum of 7 credits for a 180 1. credits programme before completing the final examination. For the obtaining of the remaining credits, the student is not subject to any attendance requirement for classes, nor is 2. there any obligation to execute group projects. The student cannot attend any classes or complete any tests in the next term or terms, due to the universitys timetabling. 3. This is based on the four ordinary terms of the academic year. The student has 4. attended the classes associated with the tests; taken the tests concerned; and tried to pass the tests with adequate preparation. Chapter 6. Time, place and duration of tests 103. Test timetable, testing room, materials In the first two weeks of each term, the Service Point will publish the test timetable that the programme has set on Iris. If there are any changes to testing rooms, these will be announced at least two working days before the test date. The programme arranges test dates so that they are spaced in an optimal way for students. The period of time in which a written of oral or test is taken is called a test session. In the first two weeks of term, the examiner will publish a list of the materials that students may use in the test. Students must also comply with the rules concerning materials set out for the unit of study; the provisions regarding these rules in the test session instructions; and the instructions given by the Examination Board. 104. Deadline for submitting work The test timetable will state the deadline for submitting work by the student other than in a test session. If this date is not stated in the test timetable, it will be announced in good time in another manner. It will also be announced in advance what the consequences are if students do not submit work or do not submit it in a timely manner. This does not apply if this information is already included in attachment Descriptions Units of Study. 105.

Chunk 40:
Length of the test session Written test A written test session lasts a maximum of 180 minutes, unless the Examination Board has set a longer timeframe for a particular student. Oral test An individual oral test session will last a minimum of 15 and a maximum of 60 minutes. This does not apply if the nature of the test session makes a longer timeframe necessary. attachment Descriptions Units of Studyindicates the length of each test session. If necessary, it also states the reason for the length of a particular test session. Page 35252 Date 06122023 B Information Technology Chapter 7. Special test arrangements 106. Language deficiency A student with a language deficiency who is following a Dutchlanguage programme can submit a request to the examination board for extra examination time andor permission to use a dictionary during examinations. The examination committee can extend the test session by a maximum of 25 or 30 minutes. Tests lasting 60 minutes or less can be extended by a maximum of 15 minutes. More information about this is given in Chapter 2 of the Education Guide. 107. Disability The Examination Board may decide to extend a test session for students with a disability by up to 60 minutes. They may also offer students additional auxiliary materials, or they may do both. Students must personally submit a request to this effect. Before the student submit a request, the student counselor must be asked for advice. The student counselor may draw up an advice per request by the student. The advice will be sent to the Examination Board. More information about the student counsellor can be found here. 108. Alternative test time or location In very exceptional circumstances, the Examination Board may allow students to sit a test at another time or in another location. A disability is an example of exceptional circumstances. 109. Submitting a request for special arrangements Students must submit their requests for special arrangements in writing to the Examination Board at the start of term. If the exceptional situation does not arise until later, students must submit their request as soon as possible after the situation arises. Ideally, the Examination Board would then put the special arrangements in place for the current term. If that is not possible because a student has submitted their request too late, the Examination Board will put the special arrangements in place for the next term.

Chunk 41:
In their letters, students must explain the reasons for their request. If a student has a disability, they must include an electronic or written opinion from the student counsellor. If the student counsellor has accepted a statement from an external expert, the student counsellor must state this in the opinion. The Examination Board will inform students of its decision in writing at the latest within fifteen working days after the submission of a complete request. Chapter 8. Registering for tests 110. Which tests to register for Students must register for tests each term within the designated registration period. Registration is necessary for written test sessions; and tests for which students must submit work that will be submitted and assessed via the digital environment. This does not apply to situations where the programme does this on behalf of the students. 111. What happens if students do not register in time Students who fail to register in time can still register at the Service Point in the week following the registration period. They will then be entered through the Service Point. Without registration, students cannot participate. If students failed to register due to circumstances beyond their control, they must submit a request to the Examination Board as soon as possible, seeking permission to participate. Such requests must be in writing and must explain the reasons for the request. Page 36252 Date 06122023 B Information Technology The Examination Board will inform students of its decision in writing at the latest within fifteen working days after the submission of a complete request. 112. Identical tests If students are enrolled for more than one programme at the university, and these programmes offer the same test, the registration will apply to both programmes. However, there will still be only two test opportunities per year. The result will be recorded under both programmes. 113. Confirmation of registration Students will receive confirmation of registration. Such confirmation does not always mean that students may participate. They may participate only if they meet all of the conditions for taking part in the test. These include both the general conditions in this TER and the conditions set out in attachment Descriptions Units of Study. Chapter 9. Participation and attendance requirement 114. Participation in group work Students are required to actively participate in group work.

Chunk 42:
If a lecturer notices that a student is not cooperating and does not see any improvement despite encouraging the student to cooperate, the lecturer may tell the student that they can no longer participate in the unit of study or module. The lecturer must then report the student to the Examination Board as soon as possible. The Examination Board will make an official decision about whether the student may continue to take part in the unit of study or module. Before the Examination Board makes its decision, it will give the student an opportunity to tell their side of the story. A report of this meeting will be drawn up. If the teaching group, tutorial group or lecturer in question has not made sufficient effort to ensure that the student cooperates, the Examination Board can decide that the student may continue to participate. The Examination Board will make a decision within thirty working days. 115. Attendance, active participation andor preparation requirements If it is a requirement for a unit of study that students be present, actively participate and prepare in advance, the Examination Board may decide, on a proposal from the lecturer concerned, that a student may no longer participate. This may happen only if this is included in the description for the unit of study in the attachment Descriptions Units of Study. Before the Examination Board makes its decision, it will give the student an opportunity to tell their side of the story. A report of this meeting will be drawn up. In exceptional cases, the Examination Board may determine that students are not required to be present for all or for certain classes or are not required to prepare all or part of the work. If so, it will set substitute requirements for these students. In such cases, students must submit a request to the Examination Board, which will make a decision within thirty working days. 116. Consequences of a decision to exclude A decision by the Examination Board to exclude a student will prevent the student from participating in the next test for the unit of study in question, unless a different penalty is specified in the unit of study description. Chapter 10. Assessment 117. Examiners Every test will be graded by one or more examiners. The Examination Board determines who the examiners will be.

Chunk 43:
Page 37252 Date 06122023 B Information Technology If a test is graded by more than one examiner, the Examination Board will designate one to be the primarily responsible examiner. The primarily responsible examiner consults with the other examiners to decide on the grades and associated feedback. The primarily responsible examiner then communicates the grades and feedback to the students. This is always the case when grading units of study that are part of a graduation programme or of a component of a graduation programme. 118. Grading procedure The examiner grades the work against the test standards published in writing prior to the test. Students have passed a test if the examiner determines that their written or oral work meets the requirements. 119. Grading transparency Students must be able to see from the test standards and the grading procedure how their results were determined. 120. Assessing work placements and graduation products The procedure for assessing work placements and the graduation programme parts will be documented in writing in a test protocol, together with the associated test forms. Assessment of a unit of study that is part of a graduation programme or of a component thereof will be done by at least two examiners, unless the attachment Descriptions Units of Study states otherwise. The Examination Board may appoint an internal supervisor as an examiner, but not as the primarily responsible examiner. The examiner, or where there are multiple examiners, the primarily responsible examiner, is responsible for the final grade awarded for the work placement and for the unit of study that is part of the graduation programme or a part thereof. When assessing the work, the opinion of an external supervisor serves as advice to the examiner. 121. Assessing the vocational component of dualform programmes and work placements For dualform programmes, the test protocol is appended to the workstudy agreement so that the vocational component can be assessed. For work placements, the test protocol is appended to the work placement contract. The appendix contains the feedback and the opinion of the trainee supervisor on the students performance. The trainee supervisor signs this document and sends it to the examiner. The opinion of the trainee supervisor serves as guidance for the examiner who is responsible for the test. Chapter 11. Grades and grading scales 122. Grading in points Tests are graded on a grading scale from 10100.

Chunk 44:
Students have passed if they obtain a grade of 55 points or more. If the grade is less than 10 points, it will be recorded as a grade of 10. 123. Grading in letters A. Grading a test with either Pass or Fail For reasons relating to programme content, a test may be given a grade of either Pass or Fail. B. Grading a test with Advanced performanceExpected performanceBelow expected performance. For reasons relating to programme content, a test may be given a grade of above average, average or below average. 124. Submitting a blank test paper If students submit a blank test paper, they will receive a grade of 10, or an F Fail in the case of a unit of study or module in which no grades are awarded. Page 38252 Date 06122023 B Information Technology 125. Failure to participate in a test opportunity If students do not participate in a test opportunity that applies to them, no result will be recorded in the academic monitoring system; however, they are considered to have used the test opportunity. The same applies if students fail to register or cancel their registration. Deregistering for a test by students is appreciated because it is helpful for organisational reasons to know who will be participating. But if a student doesnt register, this will have no effect on the number of test opportunities remaining to them. . 126. Converting grades obtained at other universities If a grade from another university is expressed using a different scale from the one applied by Inholland, the grade will be converted to one based on the scale from 10100. The Examination Board will make rules for this procedure and appoint an examiner to convert the grade. If the grade is obtained at an international university, a Pass V or Fail O will be listed instead of a grade. When a student is eligible for a designation as described in article 181. With merit of 182. Cum laude or when they need a certain average grade for further education, the student can request the Examination Board to convert the result from the international university into a grade. The Examination Board will make a decision within fifteen working days. 127.

Chunk 45:
Grade for a unit of study The grade for a unit of study is the weighted average of the grades for the modules and tests in the unit of study, based on the ratio of the weights of the modules and tests as defined in Schedule 1 of this TER. The main rule when awarding a grade for a unit of study is that students must pass all interim tests obtaining 55 points or more in order to be deemed to have passed the unit of study. This means that it is not possible to compensate for failed tests within a unit of study. Units of study for which Schedule 1 of this TER states that compensation is possible are an exception to this rule. In that case, the rules that apply to compensation will be indicated for the unit of study. The final grade for a unit of study must, unrounded, always be at least 55 points. 128. Final assessment Students must pass every unit of study. The grade for each unit of study see Article 127. Grade for a unit of study is converted into a final grade on a grading scale from 110. This final grade is stated in the list of grades attached to the degree certificate. Final grades will be rounded off to the nearest whole number, as is customary in the Netherlands. For a limited number of units of study, the final grade may be expressed as either a Pass or a Fail. That will be the case if it is impossible to express the grade as a grade, as this is fitting for the study programme. However, only a very limited number of units of study can have a final grade of Pass or Fail. If students have too many units of study with exemptions or Pass grades, they will be unable to achieve a with merit or cum laude designation. For more information about with merit and cum laude designations, see Articles 181. With merit and 182. Cum laude. Chapter 12. Test results 129. Timeframe for issuing results for oral tests and practical assignments The examiner determines the test results of oral tests and practical assignments after they have been completed. If possible, the examiner will let students know the approximate result immediately after the test.

Chunk 46:
Students receive their final results no later than ten working days after the test via the PeopleSoft academic monitoring system. Page 39252 Date 06122023 B Information Technology 130. Timeframe for issuing results for written tests Students receive their final results via the Peoplesoft academic monitoring system no later than fifteen working days after the test date or the final submission deadline of the test. 131. Timeframe for issuing results for special written tests For some types of written tests, students receive their final results via the PeopleSoft academic monitoring system no later than twenty working days after the test date or final submission deadline of the test. These types of tests include research reports, work placement reports and theses. If these timeframes apply, this will be indicated under the details of the type of test in the unit of study description in the attachment Description units of study. 132. Alternative timeframes The Examination Board can change the grading timeframes set out in Articles 129, 130 and 131. If they do so, they must state their reasons. The Examination Board will ensure that timeframes in respect of tests that are important for binding study recommendations are such that the recommendations can be issued on time. If timeframes are extended, students will be notified immediately. 133. Notification of results Students will receive a message that their results have been recorded in the PeopleSoft academic monitoring system. They can make a copy of their results as evidence. The message will advise students of their right to access their test work. See also Article 149. Right of access The message will also tell students that they may appeal to the Examination Appeals Board via the digital Complaints and Disputes portal on Iris. 134. Reviewing results If it becomes apparent, after a report from a student or during followup discussion of the test, that a grade is incorrect, the examiner can change the result. The provisions that applied when the examiner determined the first result also apply here. 135. Correction of grades If the result in the academic monitoring system is not the same as the result previously communicated by the examiner, the student concerned can ask the examiner to change the result. The student must do so within four weeks of the date on which the result was entered in the academic monitoring system. He must submit documents to substantiate the request.

Chunk 47:
The student may appeal the examiners decision not to change the result. The appeal should be submitted within six weeks to the Examination Appeals Board via the digital Complaints and Disputes portal on Iris. 136. Submission and retention of work, misplaced work For every test, the examiner or an invigilator will establish that students are present and have submitted work by recording the fact on the attendance list. Students should ensure that they keep a digital or physical copy of all submitted work outside a test session. If the examiner is unable to determine a result because the work has been misplaced, the examiner will notify the Examination Board. The student will have to take the test again. If necessary, the Examination Board can allow the student an additional test opportunity to do so. The Examination Board will make a decision within thirty working days. Chapter 13. Irregularities, fraud and plagiarism 137. Rules relating to tests The rules that apply to the completion of test sessions can be found Page 40252 Date 06122023 B Information Technology in the instructions for test sessions; and attachment Description units of study. The Examination Board may set additional rules. If so, these rules will be published within the first two weeks after the start of the term. They will also appear on the test cover sheet. The instructions deal with written test sessions but apply by analogy to other forms of tests. In all tests, students must comply with these rules and with the instructions given by the invigilator, the examiner or the Examination Board. 138. Irregularities If something happens during the test process that is not in compliance with the rules as set out in the TER, the regulations or the instructions for test sessions, this is referred to as an irregularity. An irregularity may also be fraud or plagiarism, but this is not always the case. Irregularities may result in a warning being issued. If there is another irregularity after the warning has been issued, it may be decided to declare the test invalid. As a result of irregularities, it may be determined that the test is invalid for one student, for all students who took part, or for a group of students who took part, even if they were not to blame for the irregularity.

Chunk 48:
This decision will be made if it is no longer possible to conduct an accurate assessment of knowledge, understanding, skills or professional attitude. See also Articles 144. Grounds for a declaration of invalidity and 145. Consequences of a declaration of invalidity. 139. Disturbance If a student causes a disturbance during a test to the extent that it affects other students sitting the test, the invigilator may ask the student to leave the testing room. The invigilator will make a note in the protocol. The Examination Board will decide as soon as possible whether the invigilator did the right thing in asking the student to leave. In doing so, it will follow the procedure set out in Article 142. If the student refuses to leave the testing room, the invigilator may decide to allow the student to remain to prevent additional commotion that could affect the other students. In this situation, the invigilator will not give the students work to the examiner but will instead give it to the Examination Board. The invigilator will make a note of the event in the protocol. The Examination Board will make a decision in the same manner as if the student had actually left the room. If the Examination Board decides that the request to the student to leave was not justified, the examiner will grade the students work. If the Examination Board decides that the students removal was justified, this is considered to be the same as if the student had submitted a blank test paper. The student will be given a grade of 10 on the grading scale from 10100 or F Fail. If the Examination Board decides that the students removal was not justified, the student may sit the test again. The Examination Board will decide when and how that will happen. 140. Fraudserious fraud 1. Fraud is an act or omission by a student that makes it wholly or partially impossible to conduct an accurate assessment of their knowledge, understanding, skills or professional attitude.

Chunk 49:
Examples of fraud include, but are not limited to, events when a student a. uses materials during the test that they are not permitted to use; b. cheats during a test; c. gives information about a test to other people or receives such information, either inside or outside the testing room; d. makes up andor falsifies survey or interview answers or research data; e. uses or reproduces another persons texts, reasoning, data or ideas without fully and correctly referencing the source plagiarism. 2. Serious fraud includes, but is not limited to, events when a student Page 41252 Date 06122023 B Information Technology f. falsifies tests, for example by making changes to work after being granted an opportunity to view it; g. doing the test or allowing it to be done wholly or partially by or for another; h. falsifying andor forging a signature; i. if the abovementioned under 1.d. and 1.e. occurs in a section of the graduation programme. Repeated fraud may be designated as serious fraud. 141. Participating in fraud Participating in fraud is also deemed to constitute fraud. Participating in fraud includes, but is not limited to allowing students to cheat; giving information to or receiving information from another person during a test; giving someone the questions, tasks or model answers before or during a test; sitting a test or completing all or part of an assignment in another persons name. This list of participating in fraud is not exhaustive. 142. Procedure in the event of irregularities and suspected fraud Report to the Examination Board If an invigilator or examiner notices irregularities or suspects fraud before, during or after a test  while grading, for example  they will note it in the protocol that is drawn up for each test. Student rights and obligations Students may be asked to submit all the documents, data or items that may have played a role in the  suspected  fraud. If a student refuses to do so, this will be noted in the protocol. Students may have their comments regarding the event recorded in the protocol. In that event, they may sign the protocol, but they are not required to do so. The invigilator or examiner will give the Examination Board the protocol; supporting documents, if any; and the work completed by the student, if necessary.

Chunk 50:
Postponement of grading If irregularities or suspected fraud are uncovered before the work is graded, the work of the student involved will not be graded until the Examination Board has made a decision. Meeting Before the Examination Board makes a decision, the student may tell their side of the story. A report of this meeting will be drawn up. Before the Executive Board makes a decision on a proposal to deregister the student, the student may tell their side of the story. A report of this meeting will be drawn up. Decisionmaking 1. The Examination Board will make a decision within 30 working days about whether fraud has occurred, based on the written documents; and what the student said during the meeting. If fraud is found to have occurred, the Examination Board will determine whether it was serious fraud. The Examination Board will then decide on the measures to be taken. The possible measures are set out in Article 143. Page 42252 Date 06122023 B Information Technology 143. Measures in the event of fraud Measures in the event of fraud If fraud has occurred, the Examination Board will take measures that are appropriate to the fraud. These measures are exclusively the following The Examination Board confirms the measures taken by the examiner or invigilator. The student receives a written warning. The Examination Board declares the students test invalid. In that case, the work will not be graded. If the work has already been graded, no grade will be entered in the PeopleSoft academic monitoring system. If there is already a grade in the system, it will be removed. In both cases, the letters ME Measures of the Examination Board will be entered. The Examination Board decides that the student may not take part in the next opportunity for the same test. The Examination Board decides that the student may not take part in any tests for a period determined by the Examination Board. That period will not exceed one year. Measures in the event of serious fraud In the event of serious or repeated fraud, the Examination Board may recommend to the Executive Board that the students enrolment in the programme be terminated. The Examination Board will consult the faculty director first. Chapter 14. Declaring results to be invalid 144.

Chunk 51:
Grounds for a declaration of invalidity The Examination Board may determine that a result is invalid if, after the result was announced, it was found that any of the following had occurred an irregularity that made an accurate assessment impossible, even if the students were not to blame for the irregularity; fraud; a ruling by an appeal body. The Examination Board will make a decision within 30 working days after becoming aware of any of the above circumstances. 145. Consequences of a declaration of invalidity If a result is declared to be invalid, the grade recorded for the students concerned will be replaced with ME Measure Examination Board. The Examination Board will inform the students of its decision in writing, also informing them of their right of appeal. If the work is to be regraded and a new result determined, the Examination Board will instruct an examiner to do so. The new result will be recorded in place of the result that was removed. Chapter 15. Validity period of completed tests and obtained exemptions 146. Limited validity period for tests and exemptions A test result has a limited validity period if the following two conditions both apply The test result has an expiry date, which is indicated in Article 23. Expiry date, transition period and validity period of this TER; and the knowledge, understanding or skills being assessed are demonstrably obsolete. There are no education and test results with an expiry date for the programme. Page 43252 Date 06122023 B Information Technology 147. End of validity period The validity period for an obsolete test result with an expiry date will end for the foundation phase three years after the first enrolment; for an accelerated programme two years and eight months after the first enrolment; for the main phase of the Bachelors programme five years after the first enrolment for the main phase. If the student has an exemption for the foundation phase five years after the first enrolment. 148. End of validity period a. Extension and special circumstances The Examination Board may extend the validity period for students with special circumstances, as described in the Profile Fund see Chapter 3 of this Education Guide; and for whom the validity period in Article 147 is too short. They do not have to comply with the other conditions in Article 85. Definition of personal circumstances.

Chunk 52:
The Examination Board will ask the student counsellor for advice about whether the special circumstances fall within the scheme; and how much of a delay the special circumstances have caused to the students studies. b. Extension in other circumstances If there are any special circumstances other than those referred to above under a, and in the opinion of the Examination Board they have caused a delay in a students studies that is not adequately compensated for by the validity period for the tests, the Examination Board may extend the validity period. The student in question must submit a request to that effect to the Examination Board. The student may submit a new request if new special circumstances arise or the circumstances continue. For the reporting of a study completion delay due to special circumstances and the resulting further activities, the procedure in Article 87. Procedure for establishing special and personal circumstances applies. This is not the case if that procedure already applies based on other rules in the Education Guide. Students must submit the extension request electronically; stating reasons why they are asking for an extension; and before the validity period expires. Where a student submits a request late but has a good reason for doing so, the Examination Board will still accept the request for handling. The Examination Board will make its decision within 30 working days after the complete request is submitted. Chapter 16. Accessing, discussing and requesting copies of tests 149. Right of access Students are entitled to view and discuss their graded work. They can do so at the latest up to four weeks after notification of the result of a written test via the PeopleSoft academic monitoring system. Programmes determine when and where students can view and discuss their work. This may also take place digitally. When they view their work, students can also see the test standards that were used. The Examination Board may instruct students how to view their work, for example to prevent students from disseminating test material. Page 44252 Date 06122023 B Information Technology 150. Right to obtain a copy in the event of a dispute If a student and an examiner disagree on a result, a copy of the work or relevant part thereof which they disagree on will be created, free of charge. The student needs this copy in order to lodge an appeal.

Chunk 53:
The student must request the copy personally. Chapter 17. Retention of tests 151. Original retained by the university The university will always keep the original of important written documents, such as important essays, work placement reports, research reports, theses and components of graduation programmes. 152. Retention period The university will retain these documents, as well as final research projects, examinations and assignments that students have produced in this respect for a minimum of seven years. They may be kept in electronic or hard copy format. The university will retain these documents for longer if that is stated in the universitys regulations governing retention periods. The university will retain other student work and recordings of oral tests which are not covered by the above list of documents for two years. This is in accordance with the universitys regulations governing retention periods. 153. Inclusion in university records to comply with statutory obligations A copy of the documents referred to in Articles 151 and 152 will be kept in a file or archive to be used for the work of the university. This will be done only if the documents are deemed to be suitable for this purpose. The documents are necessary in order to comply with statutory obligations, such as a visitaccreditation. They may be consulted if that is in line with the universitys objectives. The same applies to inclusion in the HBO Knowledge Base www.hbokennisbank.nl. If the documents contain confidential information or if third parties have rights to the work, this will be respected. However, a work as a whole cannot be regarded as confidential. 154. Keeping and retaining a digital portfolio The programme does not work with a digital portfolio. Chapter 18. Exemptions 155. Exemptions from tests The Examination Board may decide that a student does not have to complete any tests for a particular unit of study or a module. This is called an exemption. 156. Unit of study exemptions Students will be given an exemption for a unit of study if they have been granted exemptions for all tests in that unit of study. 157. Exemptions after switching programmes within the university If students switch to another programme within the university, they can take their test results and exemptions with them only if they have applied for exemptions in this respect.

Chunk 54:
The same applies to any results students have previously obtained in study programmes at the university that are not governmentfunded. 158. Exemption criteria Students may be granted exemptions if they have previously passed tests and examinations within the higher education system; Page 45252 Date 06122023 B Information Technology have demonstrably acquired knowledge and skills outside of the higher education system which are approximately the same as the unit of studymodule and associated tests in terms of content; level; required final qualifications. If a student requests an exemption based on tests completed in a foreign institution, the Examination Board will consider the quality of the institution in its decision. The evaluation of quality will be based on a previous investigation by the university or on the Examination Boards own investigation. 159. Exemptions granted solely based on uptodate knowledge and experience The Examination Board will grant exemptions only based on uptodate knowledge and experience. Generally, the Examination Board applies a period of five years when considering what up to date is. In other words, the tests or examinations must have been completed no more than five years before the date of the exemption application. The same applies to knowledge and skills acquired outside of the higher education system. . 160. Exemptions procedure and evidence Requests for exemptions must be submitted to the Examination Board in writing or by email. Students must explain the reasons why they are asking for an exemption and enclose supporting documents. The Examination Board may ask a student to provide further information or additional documents. It may also request any information it deems to be necessary in order to make a decision. Supporting documents may include copies of certificates bearing the stamp of the relevant organisation; transcripts showing tests and examinations, or certificates; the student must provide a full description of study or degree programmes or relevant components thereof. The same applies to results previously achieved as a contract student in the same programme at the university; copies of theses, articles, reports or coursework that have been written by the student; and have been assessed and certified by an authorised body; a stamped copy of an APL report issued in accordance with the APL Quality Code by an accredited APL provider.

Chunk 55:
The report must clearly show that the student has the knowledge and skills required for the requested exemption; the student must also provide the associated documents if the Examination Board asks for them. The Examination Board will make a decision on a complete exemption application within 30 working days. The Examination Board may extend this timeframe once, by a maximum of 30 working days. 161. Further investigation If the Examination Board determines, on the basis of an investigation, that a student cannot be granted an exemption for all tests in a unit of study, the Examination Board may decide to grant an exemption following a further investigation. This investigation involves a comparison by the Examination Board of the final qualifications that the student is lacking against the content of the unit of study. The investigation may entail that the student must pass an ordinary test. In its decision, the Examination Board will set a deadline by which the further investigation must be successfully completed. If a student sits tests which are covered by the exemption, it will be assumed that they did so in the context of this investigation. If the student fails the test, they will not be granted an exemption for all the tests. The Examination Board may determine that the validity of a result will end earlier than the date resulting from the general exemptions policy see Articles 146. Limited validity period for tests and exemptions tm 148. The Examination Board may do so Page 46252 Date 06122023 B Information Technology when the students request relates to an exemption they previously received for another programme at the university; or the programme is being updated. 162. Waiving further investigation If the Examination Board decides that a component of a test is not essential in terms of the conditions as specified in the unit of study description regarding the acquisition of the knowledge, understanding and skills required to obtain the degree, it may decide not to conduct an investigation into that component. This may only occur in an exceptional case, such as disability or religious belief. It also depends on the reasons given by the student. 163. Exemptions prior to enrolment The Examination Board may also decide to grant an exemption before a student is enrolled. In that case, the student will receive the exemption only once they have actually enrolled. 164.

Chunk 56:
Exemption from foundation examination If a student has obtained an exemption for all foundation phase tests, he is deemed to be exempt from the foundation examination, unless the Examination Board has conducted its own investigation as described in Article 173. Examination Board investigation. In that case, the student will not receive a foundation certificate. 165. No exemption from final examination Students can only obtain a limited number of exemptions for the final examination of a Bachelors programme. For this final examination, students must obtain a minimum of 60 credits by successfully completing tests. This includes units of study connected with a graduation programme or part thereof. In the case of an accelerated preuniversity education pathway, this will be a minimum of 45 credits. This includes units of study connected with a graduation programme or part thereof. 166. Recording exemptions If an exemption is granted for a test, the word vrijstelling exemption, or the abbreviation VR, will be recorded in place of the test result in the PeopleSoft academic monitoring system. This will be based on the date on which the student is notified of the decision. If this date is prior to the date of enrolment, the date of enrolment will be used. Chapter 19. Unit of study substitution; national and international mobility 167. Request for substitution Students may request the Examination Board to let them substitute one or more of the units of study which they still need to complete, along with the associated tests, with units of study and associated tests from another programme offered by the university or by another Dutch or foreign institution of higher education. Students must explain the reasons for their request. This is subject to the condition that students still meet the requirements of the examination, and that the study load in credits must remain the same. The Examination Board will make its decision within 30 working days after the complete request is submitted. 168. No request required Students do not need to submit a request if there is a partnership agreement between the university and another institution in the Netherlands or abroad. 169. Rules for teaching and testing in the case of a substitution Any classes taken and tests completed at other institutions will be subject to the rules for teaching and testing of that institution. This does not apply if the Examination Board decides otherwise in this respect.

Chunk 57:
Page 47252 Date 06122023 B Information Technology 170. Other conditions The Examination Board may impose other conditions on the substitution of units of study and the associated tests. The substitution of units of study and associated tests with those of a foreign institution is subject to the condition that the quality of the foreign institution can be established by the Examination Board, based on a previous investigation by the university; or the Examination Boards own investigation. The Examination Board may also seek advice from Nuffic the Dutch organisation for internationalisation in education. Page 48252 Date 06122023 B Information Technology 9 PART 9. EXAMINATIONS, DEGREE CERTIFICATES AND TRANSCRIPTS Chapter 1. Examinations 171. Foundation and final examination The programme includes both a foundation examination and a final examination. 172. Requirements for passing the examination Students have passed the foundation examination if they have passed the tests for all units of study that are part of the foundation phase of the programme; and the validity period of those tests has not expired. This does not apply if the Examination Board decides to conduct its own investigation, as described in Article 173. Students have passed the final examination if they have passed the tests for all units of study that are part of the main phase of the programme; and the validity period of those tests has not expired. This does not apply if the Examination Board decides to conduct its own investigation, as described in Article 173. 173. Examination Board investigation The Examination Board may decide that the examination, in addition to the tests in the programme, will include an investigation conducted by the Examination Board itself into students knowledge, understanding and research. This investigation is more or less the same as a test. The Examination Board of the programme does not conduct its own investigation. 174. Requirements for passing the examination In exceptional cases, the Examination Board may decide that students do not have to pass every part of a test in order to be deemed to have passed the examination. The Examination Board may set conditions for such a decision. Examples of exceptional cases are a disability or religious belief.

Chunk 58:
The Examination Board may make such a decision if it considers that a component of a test is not essential in terms of the requirements specified in the unit of study description for acquiring the knowledge, understanding and skills required to obtain the degree. The Examination Board will then determine the final grade for the unit of study in a fair and reasonable manner, as much as possible in accordance with the rules set out in the TER. In doing so, the Examination Board will not give any consideration to the component in question. Chapter 2. Degree certificates and transcripts 175. Degree certificate The Examination Board awards a degree certificate to students as proof that they have passed their final examination. Page 49252 Date 06122023 B Information Technology The Examination Board may decide to award the degree certificate only if the Central Student Administration declares that the student has paid all amounts due and payable by the student. The degree certificate states the date on which the student is deemed to have passed the final examination. This is the date on which the student completed hisher last test. If the Examination Board has conducted its own investigation as described in Article 173, then the date on the certificate will be the date of the investigation. The certificate will also state the name of the degree that has been awarded by the Executive Board. The Examination Board awards degree certificates within five to eight weeks after students pass the final examination. The student will receive a notification with a request to check the data that will be displayed on the degree certificate. The Examination Board will then invite the student for the ceremony in which the certificate is awarded. If an Examination Board does not take the initiative to award a students degree certificate, the student must request the Examination Board to award the certificate. 176. List of grades and diploma supplement The Examination Board provides a list of grades with the degree certificate and also encloses a diploma supplement, except in the case of the foundation certificate. 177.

Chunk 59:
Deferral of awarding of the degree certificate If a student is entitled to receive a degree certificate but wishes to wait because it would be more advantageous to do so, and if the advantage the student would obtain is reasonable, then the student may request a deferral from the Examination Board using the designated form. On the form, the student should explain why the deferral is important to him and how long he wants to wait. This is usually so that the student can complete an additional unit of study and have it included in the list of grades as an extracurricular unit of study, and not for the purpose of completing a second study programme. Deferrals are generally for no longer than six months. In any event, it is a condition of a deferral that the student not interrupt their enrolment. Note deferrals can have consequences, for example for the student travel product. This should be checked with the Education Executive Agency DUO. 178. Transcript If a student has passed more than one test and the Examination Board does not award a degree certificate to the student, the student will receive a transcript from the Examination Board upon his request. At a minimum, the transcript will specify the units of study for which the student passed the tests; the number of credits for those units of study; when the student passed the tests. Chapter 3. With merit and cum laude designations 179. Recording on the degree certificate The Examination Board may record a with merit or cum laude designation on the degree certificate for each examination for which a positive result has been achieved. For the final examination, the Examination Board only counts the results from the main phase. Awarding a designation is not in keeping with the programmes educational vision. For that reason, we do not issue designations and articles 180, 181 and 182 do not apply. 180. Basis of calculation In performing the calculation, the Examination Board will use the final grades before rounding off for the units of study of the examination. If a unit of study has several tests, this concerns the final grade before rounding off for that unit of study based on the calculation Page 50252 Date 06122023 B Information Technology of the average in accordance with Articles 127. Grade for a unit of study and 128. Final assessment.

Chunk 60:
In addition, the student must not have been studying for a longer period than the study duration as scheduled by the university. This does not apply if the longer study duration is due to personal circumstances or other special circumstances. The Examination Board will determine whether this is the case. 181. With merit The designation of with merit will be recorded on the degree certificate if  a maximum of 30 of the total number of ECs with a word assessment is assessed. Word assessments are disregarded in the weighting. the weighted average final grade for all units of study is 7.0 or more;  of these final grades, no grade is less than 6.5 before rounding off; and  the student has received no more than 15 credits worth of exemptions in the case of a 240 credits programme, or 11 credits in the case of a 180 credits programme. In calculating the weighted average final grade, the Examination Board will not take into account the results for units of study that were awarded a Pass or Fail grade. A student can request the Examination Board to calculate the result from a foreign institution into a grade, so the grade can be taken into account for the weighted average final grade. If a student has received more than 15 credits worth of exemptions in the case of a 240 credits programme, or 11 credits in the case of a 180 credits programme, they may still obtain the with merit designation if  the actual duration of the students studies was correspondingly shorter due to these exemptions; and  the number of credits for the final examination which the student achieved through tests, amounts to at least half of the total number of credits for that examination. 182. Cum laude The designation cum laude is recorded as  the weighted average final grade for all units of study is 8.0 or more;  of these final grades, no grade is less than 7.0 before rounding off; and  the student has received no more than 15 credits worth of exemptions in the case of an accelerated preuniversity pathway, 11 credits. For the foundation year, the student may not have obtained more than 5 credits of exemption max.

Chunk 61:
4 credits for a fasttrack programme of 45 credits.In calculating the weighted average final grade, the Examination Board will not take into account the results for units of study that were awarded a Pass or Fail grade. At the students request, the examination board may convert results obtained at a foreign institution into a grade so that this result can be taken into account. If a student has received more than 15 credits worth of exemptions in the case of a 240 credits programme, or 11 credits in the case of a 180 credits programme 11 credits? The student may still be awarded the cum laude designation if  the actual duration of the students studies was correspondingly shorter due to these exemptions; and  the number of credits for the final examination which the student achieved through tests, amounts to at least half of the total number of credits for that examination. Moreover, for the final examination the final grade before rounding off for the units of study that form part of the graduation programme must be at least 8.0. The Annual Programme of this TER sets out which unit of study will be the determining factor for the designation cum laude. Page 51252 Date 06122023 B Information Technology 10 PART 10. FINAL AND TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS 183. Updating the TER The TER will not be changed during the academic year, unless the interests of students will not be adversely affected by the change. 184. Unforeseen circumstances In any situations not provided for by the TER, a decision will be made by the Executive Board, if the situation concerns general provisions; the faculty director responsible for the programme, if the situation concerns programmespecific provisions. When implementing the TER, if staff members cannot agree on who has authority in a particular situation, the Executive Board will designate the competent body. 185. Publication, entry into force and authentic version This TER forms part of the Education Guide of the university as referred to in Section 7.59 of the WHW The Executive Board may extend the period of validity of general provisions of the TER. This can only be done for an entire academic year. The representative advisory council must give consent for the extension.

To this end, the prospective project group submits a form, explaining what the IT problem is, the purpose and result of the project, the research questions to be answered by the project, the technology stack intended to be used, and the phase planning. In addition, all project members individually describe which competences they will acquire with the implementation of the project. The assessment committee evaluates the request. The assessment committee should be able to form an opinion on the complexity and scope of the assignment, and assess whether these justify the chosen number of ECTS. Furthermore, the assessment committee assesses the students suitability for carrying out this module, considering the high degree of independence and self motivation required. An approved proposal entitles the project group to project supervisionconsultation during the intended term of the project, and at most two assessments. Due to overlap with other elective courses, approval may be subject to the condition that the students cannot follow this overlapping elective course. During the implementation of the project, the project group will design and develop a software product for an IT problem. The project group also carries out research related to the IT problem and the development process, and jointly writes a research report about it. After all products have been delivered, they are assessed by an examiner who was not structurally involved as a consultant. The examiner is advised by one of the consultants, who is also present at all assessment moments.
